historyText:
Opened Dec 1, the owner of  ""Uncle Boy's"" was irate about the fact that there was no fast no frills burger restaurant on the balboa strip of the Inner Richmond District of San Francisco. Looking to fill the void ""Uncle Boy's"" founder thought it would be great to open one that would serve the classic American cheeseburger with different variations and twists and that is when the journey began.
The  name ""Uncle Boy's"" is an homage to widely used nick name “boy” and “baby” for women in the Filipino community and it’s common knowledge within the community that  ""every Filipino family has an uncle/tito boy and an aunty/tita baby"" which is almost always true!

businessOwnerBio:
I love food and I love San Francisco. I started this business with no restaurant service experience and I have enjoyed the adventure while simultaneously feeling the pains of the journey on learning on the Job. Over all just here counting the little blessings that being a restauranteur brings. Specially thankful for our regulars who have been the sole reason we are still open today! "

We want to spread the best salmon to everyone.
We choose and purchase salmon from difference ocean by season changes. We select the best quality salmon from Alaska, Scotland, Canada and Norway.
We take advantage of using the whole fish. We use the belly for the raw salmon dishes; the belly fat can spread all over the mouth and melt in your tongue. We use the middle portion for the main course; the thick slices of fish gives the most original taste and maintain their juiciness when cooked.

Hospitality, familiarity, predictability--these are the key elements of the brand, providing guests with a sense of comfort upon first entering the lobby doors. The oldest of all the ""Joe's"" restaurants, Original Joe's is the innovator of the now nationally known ""Joe's Concept""--exhibition-style kitchen, notable leather booths, smooth cocktails, and renowned Italian-American menu. The restaurant prepares dishes in an open kitchen for all to see, providing hearty portions at reasonable prices. Known as much for its comfortable familiarity as for its abundant portions, all menus feature a full selection of unpretentious, old-school dishes--from beef, veal, chicken, pasta and seafood, to more new-school specialty salads, appetizers, signature soups, and custom desserts.

historyText:
Original Joe's opened over 80 years ago in SF's Tenderloin District. Starting as a 14-stool counter, Joe's became a place where anyone, and everyone, could feel at home. Over the years, versions of ""Joe's"" restaurants opened in the Bay Area, but none possessed the character of the first. Original Joe's is the innovator of the now nationally known ""Joe's Concept""-exhibition-style kitchen, notable leather booths, smooth cocktails & renowned Italian-American menu. After a fire destroyed the restaurant in 2007, the family reopened it in 2012 in a community that welcomed the rebirth of their grandfather's legacy. It now stands proud in the heart of SF's North Beach District--a mecca for natives, tourists & culinary aficionados alike. A now 3-generation family owned & operated business, Original Joe's has succeeded in establishing a high-profile identity in the Bay Area, standing tall amongst the well-known restaurants & bars--a sustainable business genuinely worthy of its proven credential.

Inspired by world famous Omakase chef Kuo Zong Kun during her travels in Asia, Julie was inspired to share the sublime art of omakase to the San Francisco Bay Area, infusing custom, personalized culinary experiences into Big Fish restaurant's DNA.

We are a small locally owned seafood restaurant and fish market in the Castro. Owned and operated by the same owner since 1977, San Francisco's one-and-only Anchor Oyster Bar has been serving fresh sustainably caught fish, shellfish, crab, and delicious simply prepared seafood dishes for over 30 years.

Anchor serves the Bay Area's favorite clam chowder (San Francisco Chronicle) and the best oysters on the West coast (Coastal Living Magazine). Check us out on the third season of Check Please Bay Area!

historyText:
The storefront sits at the sleepy end of Castro Street. Roseann Grimm opened it in 1977 when the neighborhood was just finding its identity -- transitioning from Irish working-class holdout to gay mecca -- but she never catered to any one crowd. Grimm came from a long line of Italian fishermen, an oyster bar seemed like a natural choice.

""My grandparents ran an oyster house in North Beach, across from Enrico's, and I have pictures of all my uncles in front of our house on Fair Oaks with an ocean's worth of sea bass strung up,"" Grimm says.

Anchor's no-fuss interior -- a lunch counter and a handful of tables decorated with fishing photos of Grimm's Uncle Al -- echoes the food. While it's augmented by more adventurous daily specials, the menu has as its core straightforward piles of fresh crab, prawns, and shrimp served cocktail-style or on salads, and a thick, creamy, not too fishy New England clam chowder that has yet to meet its match anywhere in town.

We are a Chef-driven restaurant. This phrase is used often, so what do we mean when we use that here at Besharam? The food curated by Chef Heena is a reflection and homage to her journey and struggles that brought her here. Often when food from other cultures has a ""twist"" on it, it is referred to as ""fusion."" We openly reject that description and do not identify as a fusion restaurant. Rather than dilute our food for certain palates, each dish reflects a story, an experience, a place (or several) from Mumbai, to the UK, to the Bay Area. It is her mother's kitchen and Mumbai streets. It is California produce and the foods she invented for her children's immigrant lives. It is techniques she has acquired with spices that she brings with her. As the Chef says ""I'm not your mom, so don't expect me to cook like her.""

historyText:
Heena joined Bay Area incubator kitchen La Cocina, in 2014, with a vision for a mobile food business. After a transformative dinner at State Bird Provisions, she altered her vision permanently. She realized there were chefs who cooked what they wanted, and ungoverned by simple provenance, they treated ingredients with care. ""I want to cook food like that,"" she thought, and at the 2016 La Cocina conference, in a panel of her peers, she declared that intent; to open a fine dining restaurant that shared her journey, her food, her point of view. In July 2019, Chef Heena and Paresh re-launched Besharam, after taking on full-ownership of the restaurant. Chef Heena has reclaimed her restaurant after a year of partnership and personifying the meaning of Besharam with a new attitude, dishes, and cocktails to show the community her creativity and technical culinary expertise. Grounded in traditional Gujarati food, the dishes on her new menu are meant to embody culture and hospitality.

businessOwnerBio:
Chef Heena started cooking professionally late in life. She was always told her goals were too besharam, an Urdu word for shameless that is often used in South Asian culture as an insult, a label for a woman who dares to do things not considered &#34;respectful&#34; or &#34;appropriate.&#34; While Heena cultivated her distinct style over five years at La Cocina, a culinary incubator in San Francisco which provides resources to entrepreneurs with an emphasis on working class women and immigrant communities, her food narrates her diaspora and experiences living around the world. At La Cocina, Heena&#39;s soulful dishes, unmistakably hers, won the hearts of Bay Area chefs and luminaries such as Traci Des Jardins of Jardiniere, and Stuart Brioza &amp; Nicole Krasinski of State Bird Provisions and The Progress, through collaborative pop-ups. As Heena says, &#34;I want to always be asking, are you Besharam enough? Where have you been holding back, and what more could you be doing?&#34;"

historyText:
The story begins in a small village outside of San Felipe, Guanajuato, located in the heart of Mexico, called El Varal, where I was raised by my grandparents, Mama Emilia and Papa Reyes. I wanted to honor my childhood in El Varal with the perfect unity of Mama Emilia's healing through plants and prayer and Papa Reyes' gift in captivating the true essence of the agave, something tequila, mezcal, or sotol will never do. Here at Santería, we have started our quest in reverse, into the beginning of this incredible story of maguey by adding an intentional element of healing and tradition into every dish and cocktail.
